# Scala Auxiliary Constructor Example

This example demonstrates the use of auxiliary constructors in Scala.  While the code is functionally correct, it highlights a potential source of confusion for developers unfamiliar with Scala's constructor mechanisms.  The example shows how an auxiliary constructor delegates to the primary constructor, and how both constructors function correctly.

## Potential for Misunderstanding

The code does not inherently contain a bug. However, a developer new to Scala might misunderstand how auxiliary constructors work in this scenario.  The example could be mistaken for an error because of the apparent simplicity.  It's important to highlight that the auxiliary constructor's purpose is to provide alternative ways of instantiating an object, and it always delegates to one of the class's primary constructors.
